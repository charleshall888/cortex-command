# Implement Phase

Execute the plan by dispatching a fresh implementation sub-task per task. Each sub-task runs with fresh context to prevent stale assumptions.

## Protocol

### 1. Pre-Flight Check

Read `lifecycle/{feature}/plan.md` and identify pending tasks (those with `[ ]`).

**Branch advisory**: If the current branch is `main` or `master`, warn the user:
> You are on the main branch. Consider creating a feature branch before implementing. This is advisory — trunk-based workflows are valid.

If the user wants to create a branch, do so before proceeding.

**Dependency graph analysis**: Parse the `**Depends on**` field from every pending task. Build an adjacency list: for each task, record which tasks it depends on. If a cycle is detected, stop and surface the error to the user — do not dispatch any tasks.

### 2. Task Dispatch

Compute batches from the dependency graph using topological level grouping:
- **Batch 0**: All pending tasks with `**Depends on**: none` (or whose dependencies are already `[x]`).
- **Batch 1**: Tasks whose dependencies are all in batch 0.
- **Batch N**: Tasks whose dependencies are all in batches 0 through N-1.

If all tasks are linearly dependent, this naturally produces one task per batch (sequential execution).

For each batch, in order:

**a. Extract task texts**: For every task in the batch, copy its full task block from plan.md (everything between `### Task N:` and the next task heading).

**b. Dispatch batch**: Launch all tasks in the batch concurrently as parallel sub-tasks. Use the builder prompt template below **verbatim** for each — substitute the variables but do not omit, reorder, or paraphrase any instructions. Provide the full task text plus 2-3 sentences of architectural context from the plan's Overview section.

**Model**: `sonnet` for low/medium criticality, `opus` for high/critical (read criticality from events.log).

After launching, append a `batch_dispatch` event to `lifecycle/{feature}/events.log`:
```
{"ts": "<ISO 8601>", "event": "batch_dispatch", "feature": "<name>", "batch": <N>, "tasks": [<task IDs in this batch>]}
```

**c. Wait for batch completion**: All tasks in the batch must finish before proceeding.

**d. Checkpoint**: Verify each successful task produced a commit:

- **Worktree dispatch** (`Agent(isolation: "worktree")`): For each task, run `git log HEAD..worktree/{task-name} --oneline` from the main repo CWD, where `{task-name}` is the `name` passed to `Agent(isolation: "worktree")`. Zero lines of output means the sub-agent produced no new commits — mark the task as failed. The orchestrator must NOT commit from its own branch on the sub-agent's behalf.
- **Sequential dispatch**: Run `git log --oneline -N` (where N = number of tasks in the batch) to verify commits are present.

Then update plan.md to change `[ ]` to `[x]` for every task that completed successfully in the batch.

For each task in the batch (whether it succeeded or failed), append a `task_complete` event to `lifecycle/{feature}/events.log`:
```
{"ts": "<ISO 8601>", "event": "task_complete", "feature": "<name>", "task": <task ID>, "batch": <N>, "status": "success|failed"}
```

**e. Worktree Integration**: Skip this step entirely for sequential (non-worktree) dispatch.

After checkpoint, merge each completed task's worktree branch back into the feature branch and clean up. This ensures subsequent batches' worktrees, created via `cortex-worktree-create.sh`, branch from the updated HEAD and see prior batches' changes.

For each task in the batch (in task order):

1. **No-changes case**: If the task's Agent result shows no changes were made, the worktree was already auto-cleaned by the Agent tool. Skip merge and cleanup for that task.
2. **Failed-commit case**: If `git log HEAD..worktree/{task-name} --oneline` showed zero lines (the task failed to produce a commit), skip the merge but still run cleanup: `git worktree remove .claude/worktrees/{task-name}` then `git branch -d worktree/{task-name}`.
3. **Merge**: For tasks that passed the checkpoint (produced commits), run `git merge worktree/{task-name}` from the feature branch.
4. **Cleanup**: After a successful merge, run `git worktree remove .claude/worktrees/{task-name}` then `git branch -d worktree/{task-name}`.
5. **Partial integration failure**: If `git merge worktree/{task-name}` produces a conflict, surface it as an integration error including the branch name `worktree/{task-name}`. Continue processing remaining tasks in the batch — do not roll back already-merged branches.

**f. Report**: Summarize what the batch accomplished and any issues before dispatching the next batch.

### Failure Handling

When a task in a batch fails:
1. Let other in-flight tasks in the same batch finish — do not abort them.
2. Checkpoint successful tasks from the batch as `[x]`.
3. Identify downstream tasks that transitively depend on the failed task — these are blocked.
4. Surface the failure with context: which task failed, what error occurred, and which downstream tasks are now blocked.
5. Ask the user: **retry** (re-dispatch the failed task), **skip** (mark it failed, continue with non-dependent tasks), or **abort** (stop implementing).

### Builder Prompt Template

```
You are implementing a single task for the {feature} feature.

## Task
{full task text from plan.md}

## Architectural Context
{2-3 sentences from plan Overview section}

## Instructions
1. Implement exactly what the task specifies
2. File paths and artifact locations must match the specification exactly. If you believe a spec path is wrong, flag it as an issue rather than silently deviating
3. Verify your implementation works as described in the Verification field
4. Commit your work using the Skill tool: `skill: "commit"`. You have full tool access including the Skill tool — do not use raw `git commit` or `git -C` commands.
5. Report what you did and any issues encountered

If this task references the specification, read lifecycle/{feature}/spec.md.
Do not implement other tasks. Do not modify files not listed in this task.
Do not add features beyond what is specified.
```

### 3. Rework (Review Re-Entry)

If re-entering from a Review phase with CHANGES_REQUESTED:

Append a `phase_transition` event to `lifecycle/{feature}/events.log` to capture the rework cycle start:
```
{"ts": "<ISO 8601>", "event": "phase_transition", "feature": "<name>", "from": "review", "to": "implement"}
```

1. Read `lifecycle/{feature}/review.md` for the reviewer's feedback
2. Identify which tasks were flagged
3. For each flagged task, dispatch a fresh sub-task with:
   - The original task text
   - The reviewer's specific feedback for that task
   - Instruction to fix the identified issues
4. Non-flagged tasks retain their `[x]` status
5. After rework, return to Review

### 4. Transition

When all tasks are `[x]`, determine the next phase using both complexity tier and criticality. Read criticality from `events.log` (most recent `lifecycle_start` or `criticality_override` event; default `medium` if absent).

**Review gating matrix:**

| Criticality | simple | complex |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| low         | Complete | Review |
| medium      | Complete | Review |
| high        | **Review** | Review |
| critical    | **Review** | Review |

High and critical criticality forces Review regardless of complexity tier. Low and medium criticality proceeds to Complete for simple tier, and to Review for complex tier.

Append a `phase_transition` event to `lifecycle/{feature}/events.log`:
```
{"ts": "<ISO 8601>", "event": "phase_transition", "feature": "<name>", "tier": "simple|complex", "from": "implement", "to": "review|complete"}
```
The `"to"` field is determined by the gating matrix above.

**Proceed automatically** — do not ask the user for confirmation before entering the next phase. Announce the transition briefly and continue.

## Constraints

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "I should look at other tasks too to understand the full picture" | Each task is self-contained by design. The plan already decomposed the work so each task has everything it needs. Reading other tasks risks scope creep. |
| "I can optimize by combining tasks" | Combined tasks are harder to verify, harder to revert, and harder to review. One task, one commit, one concern. |
| "This task is too small, let me do more" | Small tasks with clear scope succeed reliably. Large tasks with vague scope fail unpredictably. Trust the plan's sizing. |
| "I should dispatch all tasks at once for maximum speed" | Batch ordering respects dependencies. Tasks in batch N+1 must wait for batch N to complete, even if some seem independent. The batch model keeps dispatch simple and checkpoint writes serialized. |
| "This path would be better organized as X" | Deviating from spec paths breaks traceability between phases. If the spec path is wrong, flag it — don't fix it silently. |
| "I'll just run `git add` and `git commit` directly" | Always use `/commit` for all commits — orchestrator checkpoints included. Never use raw git commands for staging or committing. Sub-agents in worktrees have full tool access including the Skill tool — uncertainty about this is not a reason to bypass it. |
