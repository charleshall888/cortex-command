# Worktree Merge-Back (Implement §2e)

Consumed by the Implement phase (`references/implement.md` §2e) **only on the worktree-dispatch arm**. Sequential (non-worktree) dispatch skips merge-back entirely — the dispatch mode is decided in §1 before any batch runs, so this procedure is never read on the sequential path.

After checkpoint, merge each completed task's worktree branch back into the feature branch and clean up. This ensures subsequent batches' worktrees, created via `claude/hooks/cortex-worktree-create.sh`, branch from the updated HEAD and see prior batches' changes.

For each task in the batch (in task order):

1. **No-changes case**: If the task's Agent result shows no changes were made, the worktree was already auto-cleaned by the Agent tool. Skip merge and cleanup for that task.
2. **Failed-commit case**: If `git log HEAD..worktree/{task-name} --oneline` showed zero lines (the task failed to produce a commit), skip the merge but still run cleanup: `git worktree remove "$(cortex-worktree-resolve {task-name})"` then `git branch -d worktree/{task-name}`.
3. **Merge**: For tasks that passed the checkpoint (produced commits), run `git merge worktree/{task-name}` from the feature branch.
4. **Cleanup**: After a successful merge, run `git worktree remove "$(cortex-worktree-resolve {task-name})"` then `git branch -d worktree/{task-name}`.
5. **Partial integration failure**: If `git merge worktree/{task-name}` produces a conflict, surface it as an integration error including the branch name `worktree/{task-name}`. Continue processing remaining tasks in the batch — do not roll back already-merged branches.
