"""cortex-lifecycle-enter — composes the lifecycle Step-2 entry into one call.

Before the corpus-trim wave-2 follow-up, the lifecycle skill's Step 2 narrated
four back-to-back CLI calls in prose: create the lifecycle ``index.md``, run the
lifecycle-start backlog write-back, run ``cortex init --ensure``, and record the
session id in ``.session``. This verb composes those four in-process and returns
ONE ``{state, backlog_status, ...}`` JSON envelope, mirroring how
``cortex-lifecycle-prepare-worktree`` composed the Implement §1a mechanics.

Every discriminant is caller-passed — ``--feature --session-id --backend
--phase --backlog-file`` all come from the Step-1 resolver's output. Per
**ADR-0019's structural-guard principle** the verb NEVER self-resolves the
backend nor re-derives new-vs-resume: ``--phase none`` (a brand-new lifecycle)
is the only signal that gates the lifecycle-slug association, and it is the
caller who passes it. The composed ``start_sync.sync`` acts on the passed
``--backend`` verbatim.

``backlog_status`` reports the pre-entry state of the backlog item so the skill
can make its own close/continue decision — the verb **never auto-closes** an
``already_complete`` item. It is read BEFORE ``sync`` runs, because ``sync``
writes ``in_progress`` back to the item and would otherwise mask the original
status:

  no_match          — ``--backlog-file ""`` (resolver exit-3): no item to read.
  already_complete   — the item's frontmatter ``status:`` scalar is ``complete``.
  open               — any other status (or an unreadable/absent item — never
                       reported as complete, preserving the never-auto-close
                       safety invariant).

States (the ``state`` discriminant reflects the ``cortex init --ensure`` gate,
the one composed step that can refuse a lifecycle entry):

  ready         — all four steps succeeded; ``.session`` was written.
  blocked       — ``cortex init --ensure`` returned 2 (a user-correctable gate,
                  e.g. invoked inside an attached git worktree). ``.session`` is
                  NOT written — the environment must be fixed and the verb re-run
                  (create-index/start-sync are idempotent skip-if-exists forms).
  ensure-failed — ``cortex init --ensure`` returned a non-zero code other than 2
                  (an unexpected runtime failure).
  error         — an unexpected exception escaped the composition; ``main``
                  catches it so the CLI always emits a JSON struct and exits 0
                  rather than a traceback (the ``prepare_worktree`` pattern).

Two hard exit codes propagate from the composed primitives, mirroring their own
CLIs (these do NOT emit an envelope — the caller handles them exactly as it
handled the underlying verbs):

  exit 1 — ``create_index`` raised ``OSError`` (a non-empty ``--backlog-file``
           did not resolve to an existing ticket; a contract violation).
  exit 2 — ``sync`` raised ``_Exit2`` (a ``cortex-update-item`` call hit an
           ambiguous slug; its candidate list is already on stderr).

The write root resolves via ``_resolve_user_project_root`` (honoring
``CORTEX_REPO_ROOT``) so ``.session`` lands in the same tree as the
``create-index`` and ``start-sync`` write-backs under overnight (#319
precedent) — never a cwd-relative path that could diverge when the runner's
cwd differs from the recorded repo root.
