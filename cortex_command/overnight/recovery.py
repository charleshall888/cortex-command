"""Out-of-process overnight-runner supervision (spec §Phase 1).

Every existing liveness/recovery primitive (the in-process
``WatchdogThread``, signal-driven ``_cleanup``, the descendant-tree
reaper) lives *inside* the runner process and fires only from its control
flow or a delivered signal. When the runner itself dies hard
(SIGKILL/OOM) or its event loop wedges, nothing out-of-process detects it
and the session stays stuck in ``phase: executing`` with no live runner,
no morning report, and orphaned workers — the failure class behind #308.

This module is the out-of-process supervision layer that sits *above* the
file-based state/ipc/report primitives. It grows in later tasks to add the
recovery core, the orphan reaper, and the wedged-runner staleness
predicate; this first piece is the false-positive-free *detection*
predicate.

Detection predicate (spec §R1, Phase 1)
---------------------------------------
:func:`needs_recovery_pid_death` is a pure, read-only predicate that flags
a session for recovery iff its on-disk ``phase`` is ``"executing"`` AND
the recorded session-leader ``runner.pid`` is no longer alive
(``ipc.verify_runner_pid`` is ``False``). This is the symmetric
*mid-round-loop* counterpart to :func:`fail_markers._advisory_is_stale`'s
*pre-round-loop* escalation — minus the age term, because a dead runner's
pid is dead immediately. The signal cannot false-positive on healthy work:
a live runner's pid is always alive. It deliberately does NOT key on
event-log staleness — that is the alive-but-wedged Phase 2 signal, which
is unsafe until the planning-phase heartbeat blind window is closed.

This module performs no writes.
